# Crafting Quests

There are six crafting quests, one for each of the crafting professions. You must be level 20 in a crafting profession to get the quest. All of the quests start with an NPC in New Haven City.

Completing each quest rewards a soulbound item to the crafter and recipes to make a slightly worse tradable version of the same item. Crafting the tradable item requires the same ingredients as the quest (with some exceptions in quantity), except that the tradable items also require three Dense Ember Flux, excluding Firewater which does not require flux.
